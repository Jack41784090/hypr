# Custom Color Overrides
# This file won't be touched by wallbash auto-generation
# Add your color adjustments here to fix problematic combinations

# Example: Override problematic wallbash colors
# Uncomment and adjust as needed:

# Fix white text on orange background (group 1)
$wallbash_txt1 = 1A1A1A    # Change to dark text instead of white
$wallbash_txt1_rgba = rgba(26,26,26,0.95)

# Or adjust the background color to be darker:
# $wallbash_pry1 = 8B4532    # Darker orange for better contrast

# Fix any other problematic color combinations:
# $wallbash_txt2 = FFFFFF    # Change text color
# $wallbash_pry3 = 4A3B2E    # Adjust primary color

# You can also override Hyprland-specific colors here:
# general {
#     col.active_border = rgba(88c0d0ff) rgba(81a1c1ff) 45deg
# }
